## Game Overview

In Retro Color Jump, you control a colorful character through various platforming challenges. The twist? Your character's color dictates their abilities, and you can only change your color by landing on specific colored platforms.

### Key Mechanics:

- **Color-Based Abilities**: Each color grants your player a unique set of abilities (e.g., increased speed, higher jumps, double jumps).
- **Strategic Color Change**: You can only change your player's color to the color of the platform you are currently standing on by pressing the 'C' key. This requires careful planning and platform navigation.
- **Multi-Level Progression**: The game features multiple levels, each with a distinct layout and a specific goal platform to reach.
- **Fail States**: Watch out for gaps! Falling off the screen will result in a "Game Over."
- **Dynamic UI**: An introductory screen guides new players, and a dynamic "Learned Abilities" list updates in real-time as you discover new powers. Informative messages appear as overlays to provide in-game feedback.

### Controls:

- **Arrow Keys**: Move Left / Right
- **Spacebar**: Jump
- **C**: Change Ability (when on a colored ability platform)
- **Enter**: Advance to the next level (after completing a level) or restart (from Game Over / Level Complete screen)
- **R**: Restart the current level (anytime)
